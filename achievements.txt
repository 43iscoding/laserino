How to: Achievements.

T: Taoist (Wait by the river...)

The full proverb is "If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by".

In the level 10, you should wait until enemy cannons will destroy themselves. Then you will notice the bomb is heating by itself, so just wait till it explodes aswell.

Warning: in order to get this achievement, you should not fire at all in this level.

R: Return (Go have some sleep)

If you follow this hint in a straightforward way, you will actually get the achievement done :)

Achievement is granted when you launch the game for the second time.

M: Mulish (That thing IS destructible)

In the level 3, you should destroy the bottom left wall. It's a die hard, so it will require some perserverance!

S: Shortcut (Who likes arcs anyway?)

In the level 4 (one with the arc), you there's a small section of destructible wall right between the cannon and the bomb. Destroy it to get the achievement.
Although its visually undistinguishable, it doesn't reflect laser, so it's easy to find. 

P: Pacifist (Ignore him!)

In the level 9, destroy the bomb without killing the enemy cannon.

W: Warmonger (Punish him!)

In the level 9, kill the enemy cannon before destroying the bomb.

F: Finale (Make it to the end)

You just have to complete the game :)

D: Distress (Call for help!)

You have to call for help using internation Morse code distress signal: SOS.

You should fire your laser in a pattern ...---... - three short, three long, three short bursts.

You can accomplish this achievement in any level.
